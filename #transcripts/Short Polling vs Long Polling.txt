Hi, and welcome back to this lesson
on short polling and long polling with SQS.
Now short polling and long polling are settings
that you can configure,
which define how frequently
the consumers of your messages check or poll the queue.
Short polling returns a response immediately,
even if the message queue being polled is empty.
And this can result in a lot of empty responses
if nothing is in the queue,
and you will still pay for these responses,
even though they're empty.
The alternative, you've guessed it, is long polling,
and this is where each consumer
periodically polls the queue.
And the queue doesn't return a response
until a message arrives
or the long poll times out,
so you get fewer empty responses,
which can save you money.
And for that reason,
long polling is generally preferable to short polling.
So given the choice, select long polling
as the most cost-effective option.
So for the exam, remember that with short polling,
a response is returned immediately,
even if there are no messages in the queue,
and there's a cost associated with each response,
even an empty response.
Whereas with long polling,
the consumers periodically poll the queue,
and the queue only returns a response
when a message has appeared in the queue
or the timeout is reached.
This is the most cost-effective option,
and it saves you money.
So for this reason, given the choice,
select long polling as the most cost-effective option,
and this is generally the preferred option
for most use cases.
Well, that's all for this lesson,
and if you're ready to continue,
please join me in the next one.
Thank you.
