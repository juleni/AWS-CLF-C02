Hi, and welcome back to this lesson,
which is going to introduce Amazon EventBridge.
Now, EventBridge
is a service that allows you
to easily configure event-driven systems.
And you can also use it to define tasks
that you need to run on a predefined schedule.
EventBridge is all about event-driven architecture.
So if you see anything in the exam
that mentions event-driven architecture,
I want you to think EventBridge.
And an event is simply a change in state.
These events, or state changes,
can be generated by AWS services
like EC2, CloudWatch, which is a monitoring service,
or CloudTrail,
which is a service used to track user activity
in your AWS account.
And you will learn more about services
like CloudWatch and CloudTrail
later in the course.
Rules match events
and then route them to the correct target.
And targets can be services like EC2, Lambda or SNS.
And targets respond to the event
by taking some predefined action,
like sending an SNS notification
to let you know that an event has occurred.
So let's review an example,
and think about how EventBridge
could be used in the real world.
Imagine that one of the EC2 instances
that's running the World Pizza website
crashes and reboots,
this is a change in state
because the instance goes from running to stopping
and when it has restarted,
the state is gonna change back to running.
So, when a change in state is detected,
an event is automatically generated
and sent to EventBridge,
which triggers a rule
that invokes an action,
for example, to cause SNS to send an email
to the support team
so that they can investigate what happened.
Now, EventBridge can also be used
to handle scheduled events.
And these are EventBridge rules that run on a schedule.
For example, we can set a rule to run once an hour
or once a day or at the same time
on a specified day, week, or month.
But for the exam,
just remember that events are state changes
and they can be generated by AWS services
like EC2, CloudWatch and CloudTrail.
Rules match events,
and then route them to the correct target.
Targets respond by taking some action,
like spending an SNS notification.
And finally, scheduled events
allow us to schedule an action in advance,
like running a process once a week or month.
And that is it for this lesson.
Any questions, let me know.
Otherwise, please join me in the next one.
Thank you.
