Hey there, gurus.
Welcome to Introducing the Frameworks.
In this lesson, we'll dive into
the Cloud Adoption Framework Overview.
Then we'll move into
the Well-Architected Framework Overview.
We'll close out this lesson with our exam tips.
Let's get started.
So the Cloud Adoption Framework
focuses on using AWS
to digitally transform,
and accelerate business outcomes.
It has several pieces that we're gonna cover.
Our first stop is perspectives,
and foundational capabilities.
There are six of these,
and we'll start with security.
Security focuses on compliance and assurance,
and includes topics regarding governance,
security assurance and application security.
This also includes things like
infrastructure and data protection as well.
Identity and access and vulnerability management
are included here also.
And then finally, incident response,
and threat detection live here too.
The business perspective
focuses on strategy and outcomes,
and includes several management focuses
like strategy, portfolio,
innovation and product management.
It also includes data monetization,
and data science as well as business insight.
Platform focuses on infrastructure,
and applications and includes platform,
and data architecture and engineering.
All things continuous integration,
and continuous delivery or CICD are living here.
And this topic also includes things like
modern application development,
as well as provisioning and orchestration.
Operations focuses on
successful workload delivery,
and includes a ton of management topics
like event incidents and problem management.
Change in release.
Performance and capacity.
Configuration and patch management.
Availability and continuity,
and application management.
This also includes observability
because how else are you going to be
able to maintain successful operations?
Governance focuses on minimizing
transformation-related risks,
and maximizing organizational benefits.
This would include things like,
program and project benefits management,
as well as risk, cloud financial,
and application portfolio management.
This is also where data governance,
and data curation live.
The sixth and final perspective people,
focuses on creating a bridge
between technology and business
and includes things like leadership,
and workforce transformation.
Organizational design and alignment
are also in this section.
Cloud fluency, change, acceleration,
and culture evolution
also play parts in the people perspective.
That was a lot, I know,
but we'll talk about
what you need to remember specifically
in a moment.
So let's move on.
The cloud adoption framework has four domains.
These include technology,
which focuses on using the cloud
to migrate and modernize
legacy infrastructure applications
as well as data and analytics platforms.
Process transformation
focuses on digitizing, automating,
and optimizing your business operations.
Leveraging new data and analytics platforms
can help to improve operational efficiency
while lowering costs,
and improving the experience overall.
Organizational transformation
focuses on reimagining
how the business and teams
orchestrate their efforts to create more value,
and meet goals.
And finally,
the product transformation domain
focuses on reimagining your business model
by creating new products or services,
and revenue models.
The last piece of
the Cloud Adoption Framework
are the cloud transformation journey phases.
The Envision phase focuses on demonstrating
how to use the cloud
to accelerate business outcomes.
The align phase
focuses on identifying capability gaps
across the six perspectives we covered.
This includes identifying
cross organizational dependencies,
and finding any challenges or areas of concern.
Then we move on to the launch phase.
That focuses on delivering
our pilot transformations,
and demonstrating their value.
This is where we watch,
and learn and adjust before moving on
to the next phase, which is scaling.
Scaling focuses on
expanding those transformations
across our environment and scaling them out
to meet our requirements and goals.
That was a lot that we talked about,
but this is what you need to take away
from the Cloud Adoption Framework.
This is how all the pieces fit together.
We've got our perspectives
or foundational capabilities
that are all included
in the transformation domains.
They all lead to reducing business risks.
Improving ESG
or Environmental Social and Governance programs.
Growing revenue,
and increasing operational efficiency.
And all of that is taking place
while we apply the journey phases.
We start with envision, then we align,
we launch and then we scale,
and continue those phases.
Check your resources for a link to the ebook
of the Cloud Adoption Framework
to be able to dive in deeper
to those perspectives.
Next step, we have
the Well-Architected Framework.
It is made up of six pillars.
Security.
Cost optimization.
Performance efficiency.
Operational excellence.
Reliability.
And sustainability.
The security pillar focuses on the protection
of data systems and any assets
used by your workload.
This would include things like
the principle of lease privilege.
Securing data at rest and in transit.
Et cetera.
Cost optimization focuses on the ongoing process
of maintaining cost in the cloud.
This would include topics
like right-sizing,
and implementing lifecycles.
Performance efficiency focuses on the ability
to use computing resources efficiently
to meet requirements.
This would include topics like
maximizing resource usage and trade-offs.
Operational excellence focuses on
creating applications that successfully
support your workload.
This includes things like
event management and designing telemetry.
Reliability focuses on architecting
a workload to be consistent,
and able to recover quickly.
Disaster recovery is included here
as well as network topology.
And finally, sustainability
focuses on environmental impacts,
like energy efficiency and consumption.
This includes region selection,
and aligning infrastructure
to match demand so waste is limited.
Some examples of what applying each pillar
looks like in the real world
would include things like using CloudTrail
to log all actions performed
in your account to maintain awareness
of your security stance.
Using S3 intelligent tiering to automatically
move data to optimize storage costs.
Using Lambda to run code
with zero administration.
That would cut out any human error
to implement efficiency and performance.
And using code commit for code,
and template version control
to achieve operational excellence.
Use multi AZ deployments of RDS databases
to ensure reliability.
And finally, use EC2 Auto Scaling
to ensure maximum utilization,
and scaling down accordingly
to maintain a sustainable solution.
The Well-Architected Framework
also has design principles for each pillar,
but what we're going to talk about
are the general design principles.
Check your resources for a link
to the Well-Architected Framework
Deep Dive course that covers
each pillar's design principles in-depth.
Now, the general design principles
include stop guessing your capacity needs.
Collect and use data
to understand what your capacity needs are
prior to implementation in the cloud.
Auto scaling can help with this.
Test systems at production scale,
meaning create a complete testing environment
to simulate your actual workload,
and don't forget to decommission it
when your testing is all done.
Next is consider evolutionary architectures.
Allow your architecture to evolve
as the needs of the workload grows or shrinks.
This also includes the ability
to adopt new offerings as capabilities change.
Next is automate with architectural
experimentation in mind.
Automation can save time and money
while implementing a faster way
to create and replicate your workloads.
It can help with disaster recovery
using automatic failovers,
and reduce the impact of any incidents.
Drive architectures using data is next,
and this is a bit of a reiteration
about collecting data.
As you collect data about usage
to determine your capacity needs,
you should also be collecting it
to observe how architectural choices
are affecting your workload.
Use that data to improve architecture over time.
And finally, improve through game days.
Game days help to simulate events
so that your team can be ready
for the real deal.
Cutting back on time.
Perfecting processes,
and finding faults and performance.
With that, we're ready for our exam tips.
So of all the things we talked about
regarding the Cloud Adoption Framework,
understand the cloud adoption framework
as a whole.
Know that there are four phases.
Envision.
Align.
Launch.
And scale.
And how those phases encompass
the domains and perspectives.
Know the benefits of using that framework,
and pay close attention to what is included
in each perspective.
And finally, understand
the Well-Architected Framework pillars.
The general design principles,
and how they apply in the real world.
That will wrap up this lesson.
Take a break and get in a good stretch.
I'll see you in the next lesson
when you're ready, gurus.
