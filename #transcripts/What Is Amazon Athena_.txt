Hi, and welcome back to this lesson,
which is going to introduce Amazon Athena.
Now Athena is a really cool service
that enables you to run standard SQL queries
on data that is stored in S3.
It's essentially an interactive query service.
It's serverless, which means there's nothing to provision,
and you pay per query and per terabyte scanned.
When using Athena, there's no need for complex,`
extract, transform and load or ETL processes.
Instead, Athena works directly with data stored in S3.
Use cases include using Athena to query log files
stored in S3, to analyze AWS cost and usage reports,
generate business reports on data that's stored in S3,
and run queries on clickstream data stored in S3.
So for the exam, know that Athena is an interactive
query service for data stored in S3.
It lets you query data using standard SQL queries.
It's serverless,
so you don't need to configure any infrastructure,
and use cases include querying log files
or generating reports from data stored in S3.
Well, that's all for this lesson,
and if you're ready to move on,
please join me in the next lesson.
Thank you.
