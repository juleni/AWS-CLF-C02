Hi, and welcome back to this lesson,
where we'll discover the differences
between standard and FIFO SQS Queues.
Now, standard queues are the default queue type,
and with standard queues,
they guarantee that a message is delivered at least once.
You get best-effort ordering,
which means that messages are generally delivered
in the same order as they're sent.
However, occasionally, more than one copy
of a message might be delivered
or the message might be delivered out of order.
And in this example, showing a standard queue,
we can see that the messages
are generally in the right order.
However, we've got one message
that seems to be out of order,
and we've got a duplicate as well.
And with FFO queues,
FIFO stands for first-in-first-out ordering,
and this means that the order in which messages are sent
and received is strictly preserved.
You get exactly once processing,
which means that duplicates are not introduced.
So this is a much more predictable option
if you need to preserve the order of messages
and ensure that there are no duplicates.
For instance, this is a great option
for financial transactions,
where things need to happen in strict order,
and a duplicate transaction is gonna cause a problem.
And that is pretty much all you need to know.
So for the exam,
a standard queue gives you best-effort ordering.
Messages are delivered at least once.
You may find that you get occasional duplicates,
and it is the default queue type,
whereas with a FIFO Queue,
the first-in-first-out message order is strictly preserved.
Messages are delivered once only with no duplicates.
And this is great for banking transactions, for example,
which need to happen in a strict order.
So that's it for this lesson.
And if you're ready to move on,
I'll see you in the next one, thank you.
