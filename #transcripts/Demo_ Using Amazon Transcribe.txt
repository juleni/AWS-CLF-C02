Hi, and welcome back to this demo
on Amazon Transcribe.
In this scenario, you need to transcribe some audio
to create text that could be used in a blog post.
And you decide to do this using Amazon Transcribe.
So from the AWS console,
we'll first create and run a transcription job.
Next, we'll review the transcription
and note that the resulting file can be downloaded.
And we'll do everything in the AWS Cloud Playground.
So let's get started.
From the console, search for transcribe.
Using the menu on the left, select real-time transcription.
And I'm just gonna get Transcribe
to create a transcription of my voice.
So after I select start streaming over here,
it should begin typing out the transcription.
Well, let's see how well it does.
Amazon Transcribe is an automatic speech recognition service
that takes speech as input and transcribes it to text.
So it's listening to what's being said right now
and creating a text file
that can be reviewed and downloaded.
After I finish and hit stop, I can now review the results,
and I can download the full transcript using this button
and it will download to my local machine
And that is Transcribe.
So for the exam, know that Transcribe
is a speech-to-text service that takes speech as input
and transcribes it to text.
The speech can be provided
either as audio files or streamed data,
and when I used Transcribe to create
a transcription of my voice in real time,
that is an example of streamed data.
And then when the transcription is complete,
the output can be reviewed and downloaded.
Well, that's all for this demo
and if you're ready to move on,
please join me in the next one.
Thank you.
