Hi, and welcome back to this lesson
on Simple Email Service, or SES.
Now, SES is pretty easy to understand.
It's a cloud-based email service
that enables your application
to send richly formatted HTML emails.
For instance, the confirmation of an order or delivery,
or a marketing campaign with details
of new launches, special offers and discounts.
Here's an example of the kind of richly formatted
HTML emails that you can send using SES.
It also allows you to send emails in bulk
to all the customers in a mailing list.
It has the ability to track open or click-through rates
so that you can understand the effectiveness
of your marketing campaign.
And that really is all you need to know about SES.
So for the exam, know that SES allows you
to send richly formatted HTML emails from your applications.
Think of marketing campaigns, or confirmation of an order.
And don't get it confused with SNS,
the simple notification service that allows you to send
or push notifications, for instance,
SMS text messages and plain text emails.
So if you want to send basic plain text emails,
you can do that with SNS, however,
if you're sending richly formatted HTML emails, use SES.
Well, that is it for this lesson,
and if you're ready to move on,
I'll see you in the next one, thank you.
