Hi, and welcome back to this lesson on RedShift
and RedShift Serverless.
Now, RedShift is a data warehousing service,
which is a system that stores large amounts of data used
for reporting and analytics,
and it's designed to be used
for business intelligence workloads and is able to store
and query petabytes of data.
Now, imagine we have a distributed application consisting
of multiple different components
like Identity and Access Management, API Gateway, Kinesis,
Lambda, DynamoDB, S3 and SNS.
While each of these services are going to emit data,
and we can use RedShift to combine multiple sources of data
into one place, allowing you
to perform analytics on the data.
So RedShift is a fully managed data warehousing solution.
It's capable of massively parallel processing or MPP,
and this just means it's able to run complex queries
in parallel.
You get automated data management,
including automated data backup, replication,
and scaling without any downtime.
And it is designed for OLAP
or Online Analytical Processing, which just means
that it's great for analytics and reporting.
So if you see anything in the exam relating
to a data warehouse or OLAP
or Online Analytical Processing,
I want you to think RedShift.
Now, they also have a serverless option,
and it's called, you've guessed it, RedShift Serverless.
And this really simplifies the use of RedShift,
eliminating the need to manage any infrastructure.
It automatically provisions and scales everything.
So it's a great option for unpredictable workloads.
And as with all of the serverless options, this means
that you can focus on the task at hand,
and in this case, analyzing your data
rather than spending time and effort mnaging infrastructure.
Use cases include complex querying
and reporting for businesses that need
to analyze large volumes of data.
Data lakes integration means that you can integrate
with a data lake, which is simply a central repository
of structured and unstructured data.
For instance, stored in S3.
And you can query that data using RedShift,
and you can also use it for operational analytics.
For instance, think of a delivery company that needs
to make time sensitive decisions about where
to send their drivers based on real-time data,
like traffic conditions,
and the number of deliveries left in the queue.
So for the exam, be sure to know
that RedShift is a data warehousing service.
There's also RedShift Serverless,
which gives you the serverless option
with no infrastructure to manage.
Understand that RedShift lets you store huge amounts
of data, and it is designed
for Online Analytics Processing, or OLAP.
Well, that's it for this lesson.
And if you're ready to move on,
please join me in the next one.
Thank you.
