Hi, and welcome back to this lesson
on discovering AWS Migration Hub.
Now, Migration Hub is essentially a central location
to gather application and server inventory information.
It enables you to assess, plan,
and track migrations into AWS.
It also allows you to logically
group servers together for migration.
And overall, it's used as a central place to manage
the migration of your applications and data into AWS.
Now, one of the great things about Migration Hub
is that it integrates with the other migration services,
including the Application Discovery Service,
which, as you know, is used to discover
your existing applications and databases,
build out an inventory,
and gather configuration information,
which is saved in Migration Hub.
It also integrates with the Application Migration Service,
so the automated lift and shift service.
And it integrates with the Database Migration Service,
which is used to migrate existing databases,
for instance, Oracle databases
hosted in your own data center into AWS.
Now, Migration Hub can also make recommendations
about modernizing your applications.
For instance, you might want to re-platform your Java
or .Net applications to run as docker containers
in Elastic Container Service.
And it can also provide an estimate
for the cost of running your existing workload
on EC2 instances in AWS.
So for the exam, understand that AWS Migration Hub
is a central place to manage the migration of applications
and data into AWS.
It's integrated with the Application Discovery Service,
the Application Migration Service,
and the Database Migration Service.
And it lets you group servers together logically,
so that you can plan and track
the progress of your migrations.
Well, that is it for this lesson.
And if you're ready to move on,
I'll see you in the next one, thank you.
