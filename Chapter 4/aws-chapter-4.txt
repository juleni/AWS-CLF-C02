Chapter 4 - Storage Technology and Services
===========================================

------ Exploring Amazon EC2 Storage
- EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
- EBS - Elastic Block Store - Highly available and durable, scalable, snapshot (can take backup and create new volumes)
                            - Use cases: hosting relationalk / nosql databases
                                         data warehousing and big data analytics
                                         ERP and CRM apps
- EFS - Elastic File System - a scalable file storage solution for EC2 and other AWS services designed to be aqccessed by multiple EC2 instances - fully managed, auto scaling, concurrent access 
                            - Use cases: content management and web serving
                                         data analytics apps
                                         dev and test environments
_ Instance Stores - temporary storage, high I/O performance, no extra costs (temp storage of cache/buffers)


------ Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3): The Bigger Picture (5m 37s)
- S3 - Simple Storage Service (Buckets -> Objects(data files)) - object storage holding data and metadata
     - each object stored in S3 has DATA and KEY (unique within a bucket) and METADATA
     Benefits: Durability, Scalability, Security (bucket policies, access control list), Versatility (can be used for data backup)



------ Exploring S3 Storage Classes (3m 11s)
https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/

- S3 Standard - high throughput, low latency, designed for durability
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering - for data with unpredictable access patterns, automatically moves data, saving storage costs without performance impact
- S2 Standard-Infrequent Access - for data Accessed Less Frequently, but requires Rapid Access when needed (has retrieval fees)
- S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access - storing data in just one AZ, cost effective but less durable (than multiple AZ) - suitable for secondary backup or easily reproducible data
- S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval - designed for immediate access to data, delivers lowest cost storage for long-lived data, but requires retrieval in milliseconds, fastest access to archive storage
- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval - designed for archive data accessed one or two times per year (not immediate access)
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive - arcgive strorage that retain data sets for 7-10 years or longer to meet regulatory compliance. Has longer retrieval times - can take up to 12 hours.



------ Demo: Exploring Storage Services - S3 in Action (4m 9s)
- type unique bucket name
- Object Ownership: ACL's disabled
- Block all public access
- Bucket versioning
- S3 buckets are automatically encrypted by default
- create bucket
- lifecycle policies (bucket - management -> Create lifecycle rule)



------ Hands-on Lab: Creating S3 Buckets with Versioning and Encryption (6m 23s)



------ Introducing Additional Storage Services (30m)
- FSx - fully managed Windows File System crafted for Windows specific workloads that require native Windows features
- Elastic Disaster Recovery - is designed to minimize downtime and data loss offering swift recovery times. Pay only for the servers that are acively replicating to AWS.


------ Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) (2m 33s)
Key features:
 - Persistant Storage - data remains intact after stopping EC2 instance
 - High available and durable - data is automatically replicated within its AZ
 - Scalable - volume can be resized as data grows
 - Encrypted - data at rest and in transit is secure
 Snapshots - take backups and also use these to create new volumes
Two types of EBS Volume:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.html
 1. SSD (Solid State Drive) - faster, more expensive, ideal for high IOPS (read/write operations per second)
   Types: 
     a. General Purpose SSD (gp3, gp2, low-latency apps, 16K Max IOPS, multi-attach not supported)
     b. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2, io1, io2 block expres, High IOPS, 64K, 256K, Multi-attach supported)
 2. HDD (Hard Disk Drive) - slower, less expensive, ideal for throughput tasks
   Types:
     a. Throughput Optimized HDD volumes (st1, Big Data (datawarehousing, log processing), 500 Max IOPS, 500 MiB/s max throughput)
     b. Cold HDD volumes (sc1, Lowest storage costs, 250, 250 MiB/s max throughput)
  Snapshots key features:
    a. Incremental Baskups - each snapshot only saves changes since the last one
    b. Restore & Launch - use snapshots to quickly restore a volume or even launch new ec2 instance with desired data
    c. Share or Sell - snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts
    d. Cost effective - snapshots only stoe block-level changes
    e. Cross-region Replication - snapshots can be copied across AWS regions

------ AWS Storage Gateway (5m 45s)
 - Storage Gateway connects onsite data storage with AWS's cloud services. It ensures that data is securely and efficiently transported to the cloud.
   Key Benefits:
     - Cost-Effective - reduces on-premise storage infrastructure
     - Secure - data encryption for safe transfer and storage
     - Seamless Integration - integrates with existing applications
   Use Cases:
     - data backup
     - disaster recovery
     - data processing in AWS
   Four types:
   1. S3 File Gateway - keeps data in cloud-native format
   2. Volume Gateway - provides block storage volumes backed by S3; 
                     - offers two modes: Stored volumes (for entire data sets) and Cached volumes (for frequently accessed data)
   3. Tape Gateway - for archiving data as a virtual tapes in AWS, data not used everyday but is important to keep them for long-term retention.
   4. FSx File Gateway - extends on-premises file system to FSx for Windows File Server in the AWS cloud.

------ Overview of AWS Backup (4m 9s)
- AWS Backup - is an automated tool that carefully copies and stores data, designed to manage backups across various AWS services.
- AWS Resources:
   - Elastic Compute Cloud Instances
   - Elastic Block Store Volumes
   - Relational Database Service Databases
   - Dynamo DB Tables
   - Elastic File System File Systems
   - FSx File Systems
   - Storage Gateway Volumes
  AWS Backup Core Features:
   - Centralized Backup Management - simplifies overseeing backups across AWS
   - Automated Backup Scheduling - allows to make policies that dictate automatic backups
   - Encryption $ Compliance - keeps data secure and compliant
   - Cross-Region & Account Backup - Enhances disaster recovery by backing up data across regions and accounts
  AWS Backup Use Cases:
   - Cloud-Native Backup - ideal for protecting AWS workloads ensuring the cloud-based data is backed up and recoverable
   - Hybrid Data Protection - AWS backups extends to hybrid environments, offering seamless backup solutions for both on-premises and cloud data
   - Data Protection Compliance - helps in aligning with data protection policies and regulatory requirements ensuring data are secure
  Key aspect of AWS backup is Recovery
